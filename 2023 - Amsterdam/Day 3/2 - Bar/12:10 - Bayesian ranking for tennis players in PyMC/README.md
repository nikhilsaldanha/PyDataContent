## Abstract
In this talk, we will explore the Bayesian Bradley Terry model implemented in PyMC. We will focus on its application for ranking tennis players, demonstrating how this probabilistic approach can provide an accurate and robust rankings, arguably better than the ATP ranking itself and the Elo rating system.

By leveraging the power of Bayesian statistics, we can incorporate prior knowledge, handle uncertainty, and make better inferences about player abilities. Join us to learn how to implement the Bayesian Bradley Terry model in PyMC and discover its advantages for ranking tennis players.
